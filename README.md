ItemTracker is a to-do list/planning app built with Android Studio using Java. Unlike ordinary to-do list apps, ItemTracker
was built around the idea of public/private lists and public/private items.

Public lists and public items are stored in Firebase, so other users can see, add, and delete them. This makes it very easy
to plan group activities.

Private lists and private items are stored locally on the user's device, so no one but the user can see or access them. 

Just like other to-do list apps, it allows users to create and delete lists, and create and delete items.
